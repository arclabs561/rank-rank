# DEPRECATED: Use .cursor/rules/*.mdc instead

This file is kept for backward compatibility. The recommended approach is to use `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.

## Migration

1. Copy `.cursor/rules/shared-base.mdc` to each rank-* repository
2. Use `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` format with frontmatter
3. See CURSOR_CONFIG.md for details

## Legacy Content (for reference)

The content that was here has been moved to `.cursor/rules/shared-base.mdc`.

To use these rules:
1. Copy `.cursor/rules/shared-base.mdc` to your repository's `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. Cursor will automatically discover and apply the rules

See CURSOR_CONFIG.md for complete setup instructions.
