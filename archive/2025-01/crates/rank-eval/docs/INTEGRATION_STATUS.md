# rank-eval Integration Status

This document tracks the integration of `rank-eval` across the ranking workspace.

## Integration Status

### ✅ rank-fusion/evals

**Status:** Fully integrated

**Changes:**
- Added `rank-eval` as dependency
- Removed duplicate TREC parsing code
- Removed duplicate binary metrics code
- Removed duplicate graded metrics code
- Re-exported types/functions for backward compatibility

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 31 tests pass
- ✅ Release build succeeds
- ✅ No linter errors

**Usage:**
- TREC format parsing: `use rank_fusion_evals::real_world::{load_trec_runs, load_qrels}`
- Binary metrics: `use rank_fusion_evals::metrics::{ndcg_at_k, precision_at_k, ...}`
- Graded metrics: Used internally in `real_world.rs`

### ✅ rank-rerank

**Status:** Integrated for evaluation/testing

**Changes:**
- Added `rank-eval` as dev dependency
- Created `tests/evaluation.rs` with 3 evaluation tests
- Created `examples/evaluate_reranking.rs` demonstrating evaluation usage

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 3 evaluation tests pass
- ✅ Example runs successfully

**Usage:**
- Evaluation tests demonstrate how to use `rank-eval` to validate reranking performance
- Example shows binary and graded relevance evaluation
- Can be used to validate improvements mentioned in IMPLEMENTATION_PLANS.md (3-7% nDCG@10 improvements)

**Future Use Cases:**
- Validate fine-grained scoring improvements (ERANK paper)
- Evaluate contextual relevance improvements (TS-SetRank paper)
- Benchmark different reranking methods

### ⚠️ rank-soft

**Status:** Not yet integrated

**Current State:**
- Focuses on differentiable ranking operations (soft_rank, soft_sort)
- No current evaluation infrastructure
- Uses property-based testing (proptest)

**Potential Future Use:**
- Could use `rank-eval` to validate that differentiable methods maintain quality
- Could evaluate differentiable ranking against traditional methods
- Currently no immediate need (differentiable operations are validated differently)

**Recommendation:** Wait until there's a concrete evaluation need before integrating.

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Reuse**: TREC parsing and metrics shared across projects
2. **Standardization**: Single source of truth for IR metrics
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend metrics in one place
4. **Testing**: Centralized test coverage for evaluation infrastructure
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive examples and documentation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create `rank-eval` crate
2. ✅ Integrate into `rank-fusion/evals`
3. ✅ Integrate into `rank-rerank` (for evaluation)
4. ⚠️ Monitor `rank-soft` for future evaluation needs
5. ⚠️ Consider publishing to crates.io if useful to broader community

## Usage Examples

### In rank-fusion/evals

```rust
use rank_fusion_evals::real_world::{load_trec_runs, load_qrels, TrecRun, Qrel};
use rank_fusion_evals::metrics::ndcg_at_k;
```

### In rank-rerank

```rust
use rank_eval::binary::{ndcg_at_k, Metrics};
use rank_eval::graded::{compute_ndcg, compute_map};
```
