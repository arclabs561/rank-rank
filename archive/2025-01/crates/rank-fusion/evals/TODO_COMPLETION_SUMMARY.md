# TODO Completion Summary

**Date:** After deep analysis and refinement

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Multi-Run Fusion End-to-End Test
- **Status:** Completed
- **Implementation:** Added `test_multi_run_fusion_3_plus_runs` integration test
- **Details:**
  - Tests fusion with 3 runs (bm25, dense, hybrid) for query 1
  - Tests fusion with 4 runs (bm25, dense, hybrid, splade) for query 2
  - Verifies that `fuse_multi` correctly handles 3+ runs
  - Validates that all fusion methods (RRF, CombSum, CombMNZ, etc.) work correctly with multiple runs
  - Confirms metrics are reasonable and non-zero
- **Location:** `evals/src/integration_tests.rs`

### 2. ✅ Metrics Sharing Decision
- **Status:** Decision Made - DON'T Share
- **Rationale:**
  - Two different metric implementations serve different purposes:
    - `metrics.rs`: Binary relevance (`HashSet<I>`)
    - `real_world.rs`: Graded relevance (`HashMap<String, u32>`)
  - No immediate use case in `rank-rerank` or `rank-soft`
  - Type incompatibilities would require significant refactoring
  - Different formulas (binary vs. graded NDCG)
  - Low maintenance burden (metrics.rs is stable)
- **Decision:** Revisit if/when `rank-rerank` or `rank-soft` actually need IR metrics
- **Documentation:** `evals/DEEP_SHARING_ANALYSIS.md`

### 3. ✅ Code Cleanup
- **Status:** Completed
- **Fixes:**
  - Removed redundant `dataset_stats` computation in `evaluate_datasets_dir`
  - Fixed unused variable warnings in integration tests
  - All tests pass with no warnings

## Integration Status

### Fully Integrated and Tested E2E:
1. ✅ Comprehensive Statistics - Computed, stored, and displayed in reports
2. ✅ Validation Results - Performed, stored, and displayed
3. ✅ Multi-Run Fusion (2+ runs) - Uses `fuse_multi`, tested with 3+ runs
4. ✅ Basic Evaluation Pipeline - Load → Validate → Evaluate → Report

### Partially Integrated (Available but not auto-integrated):
1. ⚠️ Dataset Registry - Available but not used in evaluation pipeline
2. ⚠️ Dataset Converters - Available but not auto-integrated

## Test Coverage

### Integration Tests (19 tests, all passing):
- ✅ End-to-end evaluation (2 runs)
- ✅ Multi-run fusion (3+ runs) - **NEW**
- ✅ Validation of valid datasets
- ✅ Validation of mismatched queries
- ✅ Conversion preserves query grouping
- ✅ Error handling for malformed runs
- ✅ Error handling for invalid scores
- ✅ Empty file handling

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Dataset Registry Integration:**
   - Use registry to discover datasets automatically
   - Include metadata in reports
   - Auto-detect format and suggest conversion

2. **Automatic Conversion Workflow:**
   - Auto-detect dataset format (HuggingFace, JSONL, BEIR, TREC)
   - Auto-convert if needed before evaluation
   - Integrate into `evaluate_datasets_dir`

3. **Enhanced HTML Reports:**
   - Score distribution visualizations
   - Quality metrics charts
   - Better formatting and interactivity

## Summary

All critical TODOs have been completed:
- ✅ Multi-run fusion tested end-to-end with 3+ runs
- ✅ Metrics sharing decision made (don't share for now)
- ✅ Code cleanup and warnings fixed
- ✅ All tests passing

The evaluation system is now fully functional with comprehensive testing, statistics, validation, and multi-run fusion support.
