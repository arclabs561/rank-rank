# Archive

⚠️ **ARCHIVED CONTENT**: This directory contains historical documentation organized by date and category. These documents reflect the state of the project as of their archive date (primarily 2025-01). **Some information may be outdated** and should not be used as current reference.

## Structure

- `2025-01/status/` - Temporary status/complete tracking files (87+ files)
- `2025-01/analysis/` - Historical analysis and decision documents
- `2025-01/renames/` - Files related to repository renames
- `2025-01/progress/` - Progress reports, summaries, and reviews (75+ files)
- `2025-01/reviews/` - Completed review documents and fix summaries
- `2025-01/crates/` - Crate-specific status/progress documentation

## Purpose

These files document the evolution of the project but are no longer actively maintained. They are preserved for:
- Historical reference and context
- Understanding design decisions and evolution
- Tracking what issues were identified and resolved

**Total archived**: 162+ files

## Important Notes

- **Status documents**: Many files contain "COMPLETE", "FINAL", or status markers that reflect the state at archive time, not current state
- **Analysis documents**: Design critiques and analysis may reference issues that have since been fixed
- **Progress reports**: These document work-in-progress and may not reflect final implementation
- **Implementation plans**: May contain plans that were modified or superseded

## Active Documentation

For **current** documentation, see:
- Root `README.md` - Main entry point
- `docs/` - Active documentation
- Individual crate `README.md` files
- `crates/*/docs/` - Crate-specific guides (GETTING_STARTED, TROUBLESHOOTING, etc.)

When in doubt, check the active documentation first. Archive documents are for historical context only.
