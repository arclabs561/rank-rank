//! Vamana approximate nearest neighbor search.
//!
//! Vamana is a graph-based ANN algorithm that uses two-pass construction with
//! RRND (Relaxed Relative Neighborhood Diversification) and RND strategies.
//!
//! Based on 2025 research: Vamana is competitive with HNSW on large datasets
//! and better for SSD-based serving (5-10× more points/node).
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! Vamana constructs a proximity graph using:
//! 1. Random graph initialization with node degree ≥ log(n)
//! 2. First pass: Refine using RRND (Relaxed RND) with α ≥ 1.5
//! 3. Second pass: Further refine using RND
//! 4. Two-pass construction ensures better graph quality
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! - Competitive with HNSW on large datasets (100GB-1B vectors)
//! - Better for SSD-based serving (higher points/node ratio)
//! - Two-pass construction: Higher indexing time but better graph quality
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rank_retrieve::dense::vamana::{VamanaIndex, VamanaParams};
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), rank_retrieve::RetrieveError> {
//! let params = VamanaParams {
//!     max_degree: 64,
//!     alpha: 1.3,
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//! let mut index = VamanaIndex::new(128, params)?;
//!
//! // Add vectors
//! index.add(0, vec![0.1; 128])?;
//! index.add(1, vec![0.2; 128])?;
//!
//! // Build index (two-pass construction)
//! index.build()?;
//!
//! // Search
//! let results = index.search(&vec![0.15; 128], 10, 50)?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
