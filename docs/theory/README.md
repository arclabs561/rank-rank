# Mathematical Theory Documentation

This directory contains mathematical theory and research documentation for ranking algorithms.

## Contents

- `RELAX_MATHEMATICAL_THEORY.md` - Mathematical foundations of relaxation methods
- `SOFT_MATHEMATICAL_THEORY.md` - Mathematical foundations of soft ranking

## Purpose

These documents provide deep mathematical context for the algorithms implemented in the `rank-*` crates, particularly `rank-soft`.
